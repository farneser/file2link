# üåü **File2Link** ‚Äì Your Reliable File Sharing and Storage Assistant! üåü

**File2Link** ‚Äì is a simple and convenient bot that allows you to quickly and securely upload files to a server and
receive a download link. Use it for file sharing or for quick file transfers to the server.

- **File Upload:** Send your files to the bot, and it will save them on the server.
- **Get a Download Link:** After the upload, you will receive a unique link to download the file.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple interface for uploading and receiving files.

## üöÄ **How It Works:**

1. **Send a File to the Bot:** You can upload any file you wish to save or share.
2. **Bot Saves the File on the Server:** Your file will be stored on the server where the bot is running.
3. **Receive the Download Link:** The bot will provide you with a link to download the uploaded file.

## üìÇ **Use Cases:**

- **Data Transfer to Server:** Upload files for backup or further processing.

## üß© **Installation and Setup**

### üê≥ Run Using Docker Engine

**Files uploaded via the bot are stored in the `/files` directory within the Docker container.** The `volumes` section
in the `docker-compose.yml` file maps this directory to `/path/to/store/files` on your host machine. This means you can
access the files through `/path/to/store/files` on your host machine.

You can easily run **File2Link** using Docker. Follow these steps to get started:
